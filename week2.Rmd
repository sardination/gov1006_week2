## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
babynames <- babynames %>%
  mutate(a_num = str_count(tolower(name), "a")) %>%
  mutate(e_num = str_count(tolower(name), "e")) %>%
  mutate(i_num = str_count(tolower(name), "i")) %>%
  mutate(o_num = str_count(tolower(name), "o")) %>%
  mutate(u_num = str_count(tolower(name), "u"))



babynames %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(a_total = sum(a_num) / tally()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = a_total)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
